## Refactoring todo

- [X] Group scripts that train models

- [X] Group scripts that analyze models

- [ ] Use same utils for different models (i.e. ETH80, recursive) where possible

- [ ] Model-specific util files should only contain functions not in shared utils

- [ ] Share utils for analysis using same pattern %uarr
